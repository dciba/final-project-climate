# final-project-climate

We analyzed our data by looking at trends across a multitude of climate change factors including fossil fuel carbon emissions, arctic sea ice extent, global mean temperatures, and ocean heat content. We are able to use these trends and predict our future in a more simplistic way. With these trends we found a relationship between climate change as it pertains to fossil fuel emissions. By relating carbon emissions to arctic sea ice extent, global mean temperatures, and ocean heat content, we are able to predict with given data what is going to happen to all of these factors and ultimately determine whether or not we can make an impact in saving our planet.
